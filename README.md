# xtraRice
This is a rice of my own design.
If you are not a fan of the white color scheme, you can easily change it. All the configuration files are inside the .config directory. You should definitely read through the i3 config file before attempting to use this rice.

It depends on the following:
* Powerline Fonts
* Termite
* Rofi
* Lemonbar
* ZSH
* Oh My ZSH
* A very good knowledge of Unix Scripting

To install it, all you really need to do is copy all the folders in userhome to your actual home directory, overwriting where necessary.
